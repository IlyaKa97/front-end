# Common background

## Data and Information

* `alphabet`
> finite collection of signs(letters).

* `data`
> finite sequence of letters of the same alphabet.

* `token`
> one of elementary piece that data can be splitted into (i.e. by some special stop-signswhite-space). 

* `metadata`
> description of given data (about how to recognize and handle it). 

* `information`
> data equipped with its metadata.

## Formal Language

* `rule`
> assigment, that allows to substitute given token(non-terminal) with particular sequence on termins or non-terminals

* `formal grammar`
> union of 1) alphabet, 2) set of terminal tokens(termins) 3) set of non-terminals, 4) set of rules on them and 5) inital non-terminal.

* `expression`
> specific way of applying rules beginning from initial

* `text`
> terminated expression (without non-terminals).

* `formal language`
> all texts might be produced in given grammar.

* `parsing`
> process of re-constructing of the most preceding non-terminal expression from given text.

## Code, Data and Programs

* `domain`
> a language or certain subset of

* `primitive`
> one belonging to specific domain and treaten as elementary 

* `reference`
> a way to point to a primitive value or to another reference from code

* `variable`
> a named reference. May be restricted with type.

* `structure`
> a defined bundle of variables.

* `value`
> a primitive or a reference to structure.

* `type`
> a domain or structure that a value of variale must belongs to.

* `function`
> a way to produce resulting value based on input arguments values

* `flow`
> an order and conditions of functions to apply with combining their input-outputs

* `code`
> text that describe operation flow in some formal programming language.

* `processor`
> a circuit, that able to transform data (from input to output) under control of code.
