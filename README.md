# Front-End MANIFESTO
## Intro

This courses is a realization of an approach to education
  based on our original vision and rich practical experience.

Main ideas are:

  -- Lets develop you just like a product.
  Education of software engineers should be as formal and deterministic as Producing software development
  We define shapes and bounds. No any extra miles.
  We make a statement about Who is Front-end software engineer(FE-SW-EGG).
  He is anyone who have learnt and understand all those stuff in this repository.  
  It is Necessary and Enough Condition to count you one of us.

  -- Take an entire picture
  It has some price in terms of effort, passion, intellectual power.
  You have to pay it or not, soon or later.
  That why we do not go from simple to complex, but make acknowledgement at very beginning.

  -- Visualization over Explanation
  We believe that to emulate and once show the conception is better then to explain it 1000 times.

  -- Extremely Minimalistic and Over Simplified.
  Everything could be removed is removed.
  We have reduced all duplicates, legacy or unimportant stuff.
  We keep only required to understand basics concepts and to give you right directions.
  We do not try to give you wide range of technology, it is hard and you anyway will learn something else on real project.

  -- Feedback driven.
  There is no teachers who told the Truth.
  Transparent study progress tracking
  Student are main active part of process. They ask questions, propose better ways, argued with each other.
  Work as a team.


## What is your choice

  Close your eyes and Let look on you from your future. Do you see yourself as a FE-EGG? When? What level?
  We are promise you will became FE-EGG if you want it. Or discover that you don't really wanted it.
  We will show you direction, but you have to walk by yourself.

## Goals (What our goals are.)
* Establish a system that takes a student as an input
* Returns a JS developer that delivers job on D2 level
* The system should not require full-time control of a teacher

## How (How we are going to achieve them.)
* Maximally reduced set of stuff that has to be learnt
*
* Develop necessary material and techniques
    * Visualizations
    * Examples
* Each student should prepare at least 2 student himself

## Target audience
* Adequate people
* Technical and non-technical education
* 18 years old

## Success criteria (How we measure our progress.)
* Preparation time of 1 JS developer should take 3 months.
* ! Need to estimate

------------------------------------------------------------------

# Open question
* How many people do we want to prepare during first cycle?

# Misc
* Teach pupils

## Teaching process
* Reductionism
* Competition aspect
    * Graph with progress on each student
* Short term reward
* The method of loci
* Corson technique
    * What is exactly that I do not understand?
* Spaced repetition

This repo contains a code intended to express what is JavaScript language itself, how it works, how to be used in front-end development.

> It's better to see something once than to hear about it a thousand times.
